name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for
inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal
Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes
of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or
written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including
but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the
Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
     copy of this License; and

     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
     that You changed the files; and

     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You

     of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
     those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
     at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
     distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
     display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
     third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
     for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add
     Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
     alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
     that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
     the License.

     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
     provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
     reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
     Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
     distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
     this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your

LEGAL ISSUES

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please
let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a
program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used
the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with
respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness
for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user,
assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved
except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software
(or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:

     (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then
     this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty
     notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original
     files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
     (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
     documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work
     of the Independent JPEG Group".
     (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user
     accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors
     accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed
by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by
the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that
you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c
for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any
program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the
foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is
copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same
holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig,
ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is
also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To
avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been
removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF
decoders.

We are required to state that
     "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
     CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe
     Incorporated."

GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 only
===========================================
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version
number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can
change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other
code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes
to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of
the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
"you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only
if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what
the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
     that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
     third parties under the terms of this License.

     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
     of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility,
     other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you
     must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
     does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and
     performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions
of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided
that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
     work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
     work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
     machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or
     source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
     produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
     understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in
     the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
     use the modified definitions.)

     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
     suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
     already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
     functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
     modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
     modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work
     was made with.

     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
     above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
     designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
     materials from the same place.

     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
     that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
     the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
     distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
     of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or
any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
     Copyright (C) year name of author

     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
     under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
     or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public
     License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
     along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
     Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add
     information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 or later
===============================================
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by
the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined
Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding
Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and
not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code
and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs
needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding
the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then
you may convey a copy of the modified version:

     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
     ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or
     data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
     purpose remains meaningful, or

     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
     License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
     License.

     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications, if you also do each of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
     License.

     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
     include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well
     as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this
     license document.

     d) Do one of the following:

           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
           License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable
           for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink
           the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to
           produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section
           6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy
          of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b)
          will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
          interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
     required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and
     only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and
     execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
     relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.
     (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the
     Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
     use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the
     manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
     Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
     the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under
     the terms of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
     work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
     uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

2. License Grants and Conditions

     2.1. Grants
     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

          (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
          trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make
          available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise
          exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with
          Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
          for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
          Contributions or its Contributor Version.

     2.2. Effective Date
     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
     become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
     distributes such Contribution.

     2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
     Contributor:

          (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered
          Software; or

          (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
          modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
          Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
          Version); or

          (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence
          of its Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

     2.4. Subsequent Licenses
     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

     2.5. Representation
     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

     2.6. Fair Use
     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

     2.7. Conditions
     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

     3.1. Distribution of Source Form
     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code
     Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and
     how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter
     or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

     3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

          (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
          Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
          the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
          Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than
          the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

          (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
          License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
          license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
          the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

     3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License
     permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the
     terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger
     Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under
     the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

     3.4. Notices
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

     3.5. Application of Additional Terms
     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

     5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if
     You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
     compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
     Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
     Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
     ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
     come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
     Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
     notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
     first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
     from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
     Your receipt of the notice.

     5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1
     of this License shall terminate.

     5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
     user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
     been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
     to termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk
as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should
any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor)
assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This
disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of
any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of
the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply
to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License

     10.1. New Versions
     Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
     10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
     publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
     distinguishing version number.

     10.2. Effect of New Versions
     You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
     the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
     under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
     steward.

     10.3. Modified Versions
     If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
     create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
     version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
     references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
     modified license differs from this License).

     10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
     Licenses
     If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
     Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
     notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

     This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
     License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file,
     You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

     This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as
     defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

PCRE2 Licence
=============
PCRE2 LICENCE
-------------

PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the "BSD"
licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory,
is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the
testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
the library is built.

cuDNN Software License Agreement

Abstract

This document is the Software License Agreement (SLA) for NVIDIA cuDNN. The
following contains
specific license terms and conditions for NVIDIA cuDNN. By accepting this
agreement, you agree
to comply with all the terms and conditions applicable to the specific
product(s) included herein.
LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR NVIDIA SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KITS

This license agreement, including exhibits attached ("Agreement”) is a legal
agreement between
you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA software
development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here is a description
of the types of
items that may be included in a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets
and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos, native API
input/output files), binary
software, sample code, libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the
country in which
the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal
entity, you represent
that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in
which case “you” will
mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if
you don’t accept all
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use the
SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this
Agreement, and (b) any
applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the
relevant jurisdictions.
1. License.
1.1. Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable
license, without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

    1. Install and use the SDK,
    2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in
    the SDK, and
    3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this
    Agreement as distributable,
    as incorporated in object code format into a software application that
    meets the distribution
    requirements indicated in this Agreement.

1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution
grant:

    1. Your application must have material additional functionality, beyond the
    included portions
    of the SDK.
    2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your
    application.
    3. The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative
    works of sample source
    code distributed: “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”
    4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as
    distributable, it is delivered for
    your internal use only.
    5. The terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent
    with the terms of
    this Agreement, including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license
    restrictions and protection of NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights.
    Additionally, you agree
    that you will protect the privacy, security and legal rights of your
    application users.
    6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected
    distribution or use of the
    SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and to
    enforce the terms of your
    agreements with respect to distributed SDK.

1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your
subsidiary(ies) to access and use
the SDK from your secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by
the academic institution
to access and use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your
authorized users. If
you become aware that your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to
take reasonable steps to resolve the non-compliance and prevent new
occurrences.
1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as
pre-release, may not be fully
functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy,
accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial
versions of NVIDIA
software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result in unexpected
results, loss of data,
project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release
SDKs are not intended
for use in production or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release
SDK. NVIDIA may also
choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without
liability.
1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates
to this SDK. Unless
the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed
part of the SDK licensed
to you as provided in this Agreement.

You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA provides may change
without prior notice to
you. While NVIDIA generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA
may in some cases make
changes that introduce incompatibilities in future versions of the SDK.
1.6. Third Party Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with,
third party software
licensed by a NVIDIA supplier and/or open source software provided under an
open source license. Use
of third party software is subject to the third-party license terms, or in the
absence of third party
terms, the terms of this Agreement. Copyright to third party software is held
by the copyright holders
indicated in the third-party software or license.
1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the SDK not expressly
granted to you under this
Agreement.
2. Limitations.

The following license limitations apply to your use of the SDK:

2.1 You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright
or other proprietary
notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

2.2 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell,
rent, sublicense, transfer,
distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the SDK.

2.3 Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not
indicate that an application
created with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

2.4 You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any encryption, security,
digital rights management or
authentication mechanism in the SDK.

2.5 You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become subject
to an open source
software license. As examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
modification, and/or
distribution that the SDK be (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form;
(ii) licensed for the
purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge.

2.6 Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use
the SDK with any system
or application where the use or failure of the system or application can
reasonably be expected to
threaten or result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic loss. Examples
include use in avionics,
navigation, military, medical, life support or other life critical
applications. NVIDIA does not design,
test or manufacture the SDK for these critical uses and NVIDIA shall not be
liable to you or any third
party, in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from such uses.

2.7 You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates,
and their respective employees,
contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all
claims, damages, obligations, losses,
liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not
limited to attorney’s fees and
costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification) arising out of or
related to your use of the SDK
outside of the scope of this Agreement, or not in compliance with its terms.
3. Ownership.

3.1 NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and interest in and to the
SDK and its modifications and
derivative works, including their respective intellectual property rights,
subject to your rights under Section
3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from NVIDIA’s licensors, and
these licensors are intended third
party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement with respect to their
intellectual property rights.

3.2 You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your applications and
your derivative works of the sample
source code delivered in the SDK, including their respective intellectual
property rights, subject to NVIDIA’s
rights under section 3.1.

3.3 You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA suggestions, feature requests
or other feedback regarding the
SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications to the SDK. For any
feedback that you voluntarily provide,
you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual, non-exclusive,
worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple tiers of
sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any royalties or fees to you.
NVIDIA will use feedback at its
choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve its products, so you
may send feedback to NVIDIA through
the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.
4. No Warranties.

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “ASIS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR
PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE
BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.
5. Limitations of Liability.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF
DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE
COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE
OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH OF
CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S
AND ITS AFFILIATES TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE
LIABILITY OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply regardless if NVIDIA
or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a remedy fails its
essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the bargain between the
parties, and, absent any of these exclusions
or limitations of liability, the provisions of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the economic terms, would
be substantially different.
6. Termination.

6.1 This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
NVIDIA as described below.

6.2 If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by stopping to use
the SDK.

6.3 NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if: (i) you fail to
comply with any term of this Agreement and
the non-compliance is not fixed within thirty (30) days following notice from
NVIDIA (or immediately if you violate
NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights); (ii) you commence or participate in any
legal proceeding against NVIDIA with
respect to the SDK; or (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in a
country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion,
the continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

6.4 Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to promptly discontinue
use of the SDK and destroy all copies in
your possession or control. Your prior distributions in accordance with this
Agreement are not affected by the
termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you will certify in
writing that you have complied with your
commitments under this section. Upon any termination of this Agreement all
provisions survive except for the licenses
granted to you.
7. General.

If you wish to assign this Agreement or your rights and obligations, including
by merger, consolidation, dissolution or
operation of law, contact NVIDIA to ask for permission. Any attempted
assignment not approved by NVIDIA in writing shall
be void and of no effect. NVIDIA may assign, delegate or transfer this
Agreement and its rights and obligations, and if
to a non-affiliate you will be notified.

You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably requested information
to verify your compliance with this Agreement.

This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the United
States and of the State of Delaware as those
laws are applied to contracts entered into and performed entirely within
Delaware by Delaware residents, without regard
to the conflicts of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is
specifically disclaimed. You agree to all terms of this Agreement in the
English language.

The state or federal courts residing in Santa Clara County, California shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over any
dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree
that NVIDIA shall still be allowed to
apply for injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief in
any jurisdiction.

If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this
Agreement is illegal, invalid or unenforceable,
such provision will be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be
consistent with and fully enforceable under the
law and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Unless
otherwise specified, remedies are cumulative.

GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 only
===========================================
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version
number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can
change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other
code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes
to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of
the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
"you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only
if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what
the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
     that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
     third parties under the terms of this License.

     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
     of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility,
     other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you
     must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
     does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and
     performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions
of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided
that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
     work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
     work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
     machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or
     source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
     produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
     understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in
     the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
     use the modified definitions.)

     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
     suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
     already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
     functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
     modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
     modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work
     was made with.

     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
     above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
     designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
     materials from the same place.

     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
     that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
     the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
     distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
     of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or
any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
     Copyright (C) year name of author

     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
     under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
     or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public
     License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
     along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
     Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add
     information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 only
===========================================
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by
the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined
Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding
Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and
not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code
and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs
needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding
the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then
you may convey a copy of the modified version:

     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
     ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or
     data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
     purpose remains meaningful, or

     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
     License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
     License.

     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications, if you also do each of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
     License.

     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
     include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well
     as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this
     license document.

     d) Do one of the following:

           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
           License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable
           for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink
           the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to
           produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section
           6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy
          of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b)
          will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
          interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
     required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and
     only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and
     execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
     relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.
     (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the
     Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
     use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the
     manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
     Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
     the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under
     the terms of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
     work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
     uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------

Release Date: May 21, 2019
--------------------------

Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.

1.1. License

1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.

1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.

1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.

1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.

1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.

1.1.6. Third Party Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, third party software licensed by a NVIDIA
supplier and/or open source software provided under an open
source license. Use of third party software is subject to the
third-party license terms, or in the absence of third party
terms, the terms of this Agreement. Copyright to third party
software is held by the copyright holders indicated in the
third-party software or license.

1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.

1.2. Limitations

The following license limitations apply to your use of the
SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
        or

      c. Redistributable at no charge.

  6. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not use the SDK with any system or
    application where the use or failure of the system or
    application can reasonably be expected to threaten or
    result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic loss.
    Examples include use in nuclear, avionics, navigation,
    military, medical, life support or other life critical
    applications. NVIDIA does not design, test or manufacture
    the SDK for these critical uses and NVIDIA shall not be
    liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for
    any claims or damages arising from such uses.

  7. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to your use of
    the SDK outside of the scope of this Agreement, or not in
    compliance with its terms.

1.3. Ownership

  1. NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights described here .
    This SDK may include software and materials from
    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2. You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights described here .

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its
    choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
    its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through
    the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.

1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL
FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.

1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS
OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF
PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK,
WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH
OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF
LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.

1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
    stopping to use the SDK.

  3. NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if:

      a. (i) you fail to comply with any term of this
        Agreement and the non-compliance is not fixed within
        thirty (30) days following notice from NVIDIA (or
        immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual
        property rights);

      b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal
        proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or

      c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in
        a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the
        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
    termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you
    will certify in writing that you have complied with your
    commitments under this section. Upon any termination of
    this Agreement all provisions survive except for the
    license grant provisions.

1.7. General

provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, such provision will be construed as limited to
the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully
enforceable under the law and the remaining provisions will
remain in full force and effect. Unless otherwise specified,

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
Release Date: July 26, 2018
Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing, copying or using the
licensed software:

This license agreement, including exhibits attached ("Agreement”) is a legal
agreement between
you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA software
development
kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here is a description
of the types of
items that may be included in a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets
and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos, native API
input/output files),
binary software, sample code, libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the
country in which
the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal
entity, you represent
that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in
which case “you” will
mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if
you don’t accept all
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use the
SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this
Agreement, and (b) any
applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the
relevant jurisdictions.
1.1. License

1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable
license, without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

    1. Install and use the SDK,
    2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in
    the SDK, and
    3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this
    Agreement as distributable,
    as incorporated in object code format into a software application that
    meets the distribution
    requirements indicated in this Agreement.

1.1.2. Distribution Requirements
These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution
grant:

    1. Your application must have material additional functionality, beyond the
    included portions
    of the SDK.
    2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your
    application.
    3. The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative
    works of sample source
    code distributed: “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”
    4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as
    distributable, it is delivered for
    your internal use only.
    5. The terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent
    with the terms of this
    Agreement, including (without limitation) terms relating to the license
    grant and license
    restrictions and protection of NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights.
    Additionally, you agree that
    you will protect the privacy, security and legal rights of your application
    users.
    6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected
    distribution or use of the SDK
    not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your
    agreements with respect to distributed SDK.

1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your
subsidiary(ies) to access and use
the SDK from your secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by
the academic institution
to access and use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your
authorized users. If
you become aware that your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to
take reasonable steps to resolve the non-compliance and prevent new
occurrences.

1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as
pre-release, may not be fully
functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy,
accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial
versions of NVIDIA
software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result in unexpected
results, loss of data,
project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release
SDKs are not intended
for use in production or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release
SDK. NVIDIA may also
choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without
liability.

1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates
to this SDK.
Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are
deemed part of the SDK
licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You agree that the form and
content of the SDK that
NVIDIA provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally
maintains compatibility
between versions, NVIDIA may in some cases make changes that introduce
incompatibilities in future
versions of the SDK.

1.1.6. Third Party Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with,
third party software
licensed by a NVIDIA supplier and/or open source software provided under an
open source license.
Use of third party software is subject to the third-party license terms, or in
the absence of third
party terms, the terms of this Agreement. Copyright to third party software is
held by the copyright
holders indicated in the third-party software or license.

1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the SDK, not
expressly granted to you under
this Agreement.

1.2. Limitations
The following license limitations apply to your use of the SDK:

    1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove
    copyright or other proprietary
    notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.
    2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell,
    rent, sublicense,
    transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of
    the SDK. For clarity, you
    may not distribute or sublicense the SDK as a stand-alone product.
    3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not
    indicate that an application
    created with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.
    4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any encryption, security,
    digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.
    5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become
    subject to an open source
    software license. As examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or
    distribution that the SDK be:
        a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;
        b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or
        c. Redistributable at no charge.
    6. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not
    use the SDK with any system
    or application where the use or failure of the system or application can
    reasonably be expected to
    threaten or result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic loss.
    Examples include use in nuclear,
    avionics, navigation, military, medical, life support or other life
    critical applications. NVIDIA does
    not design, test or manufacture the SDK for these critical uses and NVIDIA
    shall not be liable to you
    or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising
    from such uses.
    7. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its
    affiliates, and their respective
    employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against
    any and all claims, damages,
    obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not
    limited to attorney’s fees and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising
    out of or related to your use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement, or not in compliance
    with its terms.

1.3. Ownership

    1. NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and interest in and to
    the SDK and its modifications
    and derivative works, including their respective intellectual property
    rights, subject to your rights
    described here . This SDK may include software and materials from NVIDIA’s
    licensors, and these
    licensors are intended third party beneficiaries that may enforce this
    Agreement with respect to their
    intellectual property rights.
    2. You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your applications and
    your derivative works of the
    sample source code delivered in the SDK, including their respective
    intellectual property rights,
    subject to NVIDIA’s rights described here .
    3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA suggestions, feature
    requests or other feedback
    regarding the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications to the
    SDK. For any feedback that
    you voluntarily provide, you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a
    perpetual, non-exclusive,
    worldwide, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, license,
    sublicense (through multiple tiers
    of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple tiers of distributors)
    it without the payment of
    any royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its choice.
    NVIDIA is constantly looking
    for ways to improve its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA
    through the developer portal
    at https://developer.nvidia.com.

1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR
NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS
THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT
OR PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING
OR COURSE OF TRADE.

1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS
OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES
FROM ANY CLAIM BASED
UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY
OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS
AFFILIATES TOTAL
CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00.
THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY
OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply regardless if NVIDIA
or its affiliates have
been advised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential
purpose. These exclusions and limitations of liability form an essential basis
of the bargain between
the parties, and, absent any of these exclusions or limitations of liability,
the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms, would be
substantially different.
1.6. Termination

    1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
    NVIDIA as described below.
    2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by stopping to
    use the SDK.
    3. NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if:
        a. (i) you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement and the
        non-compliance is not fixed
        within thirty (30) days following notice from NVIDIA (or immediately if
        you violate NVIDIA’s
        intellectual property rights);
        b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against
        NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or
        c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in a country or,
        in NVIDIA’s sole discretion,
        the continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.
    4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to promptly
    discontinue use of the SDK and destroy
    all copies in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are
    not affected by the termination of this Agreement. Upon written request,
    you will certify in writing that
    you have complied with your commitments under this section. Upon any
    termination of this Agreement all
    provisions survive except for the license grant provisions.

1.7. General

If you wish to assign this Agreement or your rights and obligations, including
by merger, consolidation,
dissolution or operation of law, contact NVIDIA to ask for permission. Any
attempted assignment not approved
by NVIDIA in writing shall be void and of no effect. NVIDIA may assign,
delegate or transfer this Agreement
and its rights and obligations, and if to a non-affiliate you will be notified.

You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably requested information
to verify your compliance with
this Agreement.

This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the United
States and of the State of Delaware
as those laws are applied to contracts entered into and performed entirely
within Delaware by Delaware residents,
without regard to the conflicts of laws principles. The United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed. You agree to all terms
of this Agreement in the English
language.

The state or federal courts residing in Santa Clara County, California shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over
any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you
agree that NVIDIA shall still be
allowed to apply for injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal
relief in any jurisdiction.

If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this
Agreement is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent
necessary to be consistent with and

    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

QuaZip License
==============
GNU Lesser General Public License V2.1 plus a static linking exception

This file contains information about licensing information for the
QuaZip library. It is the definitive source of such information, and
takes priority over any copyright notices that might be found in the
source code. All of those copyright notices are there just to reference
this file, which they all should do, except the notices in the original
ZIP/UNZIP package (MiniZip), which is included in the QuaZip library in
a modified state, as its license permits.

If some source file contains a copyright notice that neither marks that
file as clearly belonging to the MiniZip project nor references this
file, then it's a bug and should be reported to
https://github.com/stachenov/quazip/issues

The QuaZip library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License V2.1 plus a static linking exception.

The original ZIP/UNZIP package (MiniZip) is copyrighted by Gilles
Vollant and contributors, see quazip/(un)zip.h files for details.
Basically it's the zlib license.

STATIC LINKING EXCEPTION

The copyright holders give you permission to link this library with
independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license
terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also
meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of
the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is
not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library,
you must extend this exception to your version of the library.

The text of the GNU Lesser General Public License V2.1 follows.

    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
         Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

       Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

       NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
